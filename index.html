                        Hello! My name is Joel Jones, and this is my website. I was born and raised in the beautiful
                        city of
                        Vancouver, Washington, located just across the river from Portland, Oregon. Vancouver has always
                        been my
                        home - I grew up here with my large family of nine siblings. I am the youngest of the family, so
                        I
                        always
                        had a lot of older brothers and sisters to look up to and learn from as I was growing up. My
                        parents
                        have
                        lived in Washington for their whole lives. I also have many aunts and uncles who live in this
                        area
                        near my
                        family. <br> <br>
                        Now that I am finishing up high school and am looking ahead to my future career options, I find
                        myself
                        feeling uncertain about which path is right for me. For the past couple of years, I have been
                        very
                        interested in getting into software development or engineering. I am good with computers and
                        logical
                        thinking, and I like the idea of creatively solving problems and building useful products and
                        apps
                        that
                        people use every day. However, as I have researched the tech industry more lately, I have felt
                        somewhat
                        discouraged. With outsourcing, automation, and shifting H-1B visa policies, the job security and
                        opportunities in that field do not seem as stable as they once did compared to other options I
                        am
                        considering. I do not want to invest years of training in a career that could leave me
                        struggling to
                        find a
                        job. So, for now, I remain open-minded about different career paths as I work and volunteer in
                        various areas
                        that interest me. I have been researching many of the trades, specifically plumbing, but I do
                        not
                        know
                        exactly what God is calling me to do. My goal is to find something I am passionate about that
                        will
                        also
                        provide me with a stable, fulfilling lifestyle long-term.
