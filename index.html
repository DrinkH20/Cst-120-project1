            Hello! My name is Joel Jones, and this is my website. I was born and raised in the beautiful city of
            Vancouver, Washington, located just across the river from Portland, Oregon. Vancouver has always been my
            home - I grew up here with my large family of nine siblings. I am the youngest of the family, so I always
            had a lot of older brothers and sisters to look up to and learn from as I was growing up. My parents have
            lived in Washington for their whole lives. I also have many aunts and uncles who live in this area near my
            family. <br> <br>
            Now that I am finishing up high school and am looking ahead to my future career options, I find myself
            feeling uncertain about which path is right for me. For the past couple of years, I have been very
            interested in getting into software development or engineering. I am good with computers and logical
            thinking, and I like the idea of creatively solving problems and building useful products and apps that
            people use every day. However, as I have researched the tech industry more lately, I have felt somewhat
            discouraged. With outsourcing, automation, and shifting H-1B visa policies, the job security and
            opportunities in that field do not seem as stable as they once did compared to other options I am
            considering. I do not want to invest years of training in a career that could leave me struggling to find a
            job. So, for now, I remain open-minded about different career paths as I work and volunteer in various areas
            that interest me. I have been researching many of the trades, specifically plumbing, but I do not know
            exactly what God is calling me to do. My goal is to find something I am passionate about that will also
            provide me with a stable, fulfilling lifestyle long-term.
